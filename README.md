# OpenXRSample
An incredibly simple C++ sample of the openXR API.
This program simply has a moveable camera and a simple shader that uses an MVP matrix.
This program doesn't implement Cylinder or Quad layers, nor Action Inputs/Controllers
I may add controller support/Cylinder layer support in the future.
Building in visual studio is done using the x64 debug profile
